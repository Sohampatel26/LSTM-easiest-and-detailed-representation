# LSTM-easiest-and-detailed-representation

I am currently working on a Repository where am posting my daily updates of things am revisiting and learning in very detail in the field of Machine Learning, 

So while learning LSTM I found it to be very challenging (mathematics part) so I decided to make notes in the easiest and most detailed manner so that it could help people save time.
